# Getting Started with Theme Development from Scratch

---

## Step 1: Install Theme Kit
`choco install themekit`

## Step 2: Get a Theme password
After you install Theme Kit, you need to get a Theme password to connect Theme Kit to your store and manage your template files.
The store owner or a staff member with the appropriate permissions can create a Theme password for you using the Theme Access app.

## Step 3: Connect to an existing theme
`theme configure -s [Shop Name] -t [ShopID] -p [Access Key]`

## Step 4: Watch the changes on live theme
`theme watch --allow-live`
